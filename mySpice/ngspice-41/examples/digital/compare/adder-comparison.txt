Compare five different 4-bit full adders,
made of NAND gates
Simulating for 6400ns

adder_bib
The old spice bipolar NAND gate full adder
Simulation time 14.0s

adder_mos
A MOS NAND gate inverter, using BSIM3 and OpenMP
Simulation time 10.5s

adder_behav
NAND gates made with XSPICE digital devices,
but each has an analog interface, the interconnect
is analog, gate library is 74HCng_short_2.lib
Simulation time 1.9s

adder_Xspice
Fully digital, event node based NAND gates
digital plotting into vcd file, display with gtkwave
Simulation time 0.27s

adder_esource
Uses the NAND variant of the E-type behavioral voltage source.

There are further variations of adder_Xspice in directory
examples/digital/auto_bridge.
