<p>Welcome to Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT), a software development platform providing services for 3D surface and solid modeling, CAD data exchange, and visualization. Most of OCCT functionality is available in the form of C++ libraries. OCCT can be best applied in development of software dealing with 3D modeling (CAD), manufacturing / measuring (CAM) or numerical simulation (CAE).</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="intro_overview"></a>
Overview</h1>
<p>Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT) is an object-oriented C++ class library designed for rapid production of sophisticated domain-specific CAD/CAM/CAE applications.</p>
<p>A typical application developed using OCCT deals with two or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) geometric modeling in general-purpose or specialized Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems, manufacturing or analysis applications, simulation applications, or even illustration tools.</p>
<p>OCCT library is designed to be truly modular and extensible, providing C++ classes for:</p><ul>
<li>Basic data structures (geometric modeling, visualization, interactive selection and application specific services);</li>
<li>Modeling algorithms;</li>
<li>Working with mesh (faceted) data;</li>
<li>Data interoperability with neutral formats (IGES, STEP);</li>
</ul>
<p>The C++ classes and other types are grouped into packages. Packages are organized into toolkits (libraries), to which you can link your application. Finally, toolkits are grouped into seven modules.</p>
<p>This modular structure is illustrated in the diagram below.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_overview_fclasses"></a>
Foundation Classes</h2>
<p><b>Foundation Classes</b> module contains data structures and services used by higher-level Open CASCADE Technology classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primitive types, such as Boolean, Character, Integer or Real;</li>
<li>String classes that handle Unicode strings;</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_overview_moddata"></a>
Modeling Data</h2>
<p><b>Modeling Data</b> supplies data structures to implement boundary representation (BRep) of objects in 3D. In BRep the shape is represented as an aggregation of geometry within topology. The geometry is understood as a mathematical description of a shape, e.g. as curves and surfaces (simple or canonical, Bezier, NURBS, etc). The topology is a data structure binding geometrical objects together.</p>
<p>Geometry types and utilities provide geometric data structures and services for:</p><ul>
<li>Description of points, vectors, curves and surfaces:<ul>
<li>their positioning in 3D space using axis or coordinate systems, and</li>
<li>their geometric transformation, by applying translations, rotations, symmetries, scaling transformations and combinations thereof.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creation of parametric curves and surfaces by interpolation and approximation;</li>
<li>Algorithms of direct construction;</li>
<li>Conversion of curves and surfaces to NURBS form;</li>
<li>Computation of point coordinates on 2D and 3D curves;</li>
<li>Calculation of extrema between geometric objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Topology defines relationships between simple geometric entities. A shape, which is a basic topological entity, can be divided into components (sub-shapes):</p><ul>
<li>Vertex &ndash; a zero-dimensional shape corresponding to a point;</li>
<li>Edge &ndash; a shape corresponding to a curve and bounded by a vertex at each extremity;</li>
<li>Wire &ndash; a sequence of edges connected by their vertices;</li>
<li>Face &ndash; a part of a plane (in 2D) or a surface (in 3D) bounded by wires;</li>
<li>Shell &ndash; a collection of faces connected by edges of their wire boundaries;</li>
<li>Solid &ndash; a finite closed part of 3D space bounded by shells;</li>
<li>Composite solid &ndash; a collection of solids connected by faces of their shell boundaries;</li>
<li>Compound &ndash; a collection of shapes of arbitrary type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complex shapes can be defined as assemblies (compounds) of simpler entities.</p>
<p>See the details in <a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__modeling_data.html">Modeling Data User's Guide</a></p>
<p>3D geometric models can be stored in OCCT native BREP format. See <a class="el" href="specification__brep_format.html">BREP Format Description White Paper</a> for details on the format.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_overview_modalgo"></a>
Modeling Algorithms</h2>
<p><b>Modeling Algorithms</b> module groups a wide range of topological and geometric algorithms used in geometric modeling. Basically, there are two groups of algorithms in Open CASCADE Technology:</p><ul>
<li>High-level modeling routines used in the real design;</li>

<li>Construct lines and circles from constraints;</li>
<li>Construct free-form curves and surfaces from constraints (interpolation, approximation, skinning, gap filling, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Low-level <em>topological tools</em> provide the algorithms, which:</p><ul>
<li>Tessellate shapes;</li>
<li>Check correct definition of shapes;</li>

<li>Perform affine transformations;</li>
<li>Find planes in which edges are located;</li>
<li>Convert shapes to NURBS geometry;</li>
<li>Sew connected topologies (shells and wires) from separate topological elements (faces and edges).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_overview_mesh"></a>
Mesh</h2>
<p><b>Mesh</b> toolkit provides the functionality to work with tessellated representations of objects in form of triangular facets. This toolkit contains:</p><ul>
<li>data structures to store surface mesh data associated to shapes and basic algorithms to handle them;</li>
<li>data structures and algorithms to build triangular surface mesh from <em>BRep</em> objects (shapes);</li>
<li>tools for displaying meshes with associated pre- and post-processor data (scalars or vectors).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_overview_visu"></a>
Visualization</h2>
<p><b>Visualization</b> module provides ready-to-use algorithms to create graphic presentations from various objects: shapes, meshes, etc.</p>
<p>In Open CASCADE Technology visualization is based on the separation of CAD data and its graphical presentation. The module also supports a fast and powerful interactive selection mechanism.</p>
<p>Visualization module relies on the following key toolkits:</p><ul>
<li><em>TKV3d</em> toolkit defines a high-level API called (Application Interactive Services* (<a class="elRef" doxygen="E:/builds/OCCT-750_OCCT-750/OCCT_SRC/doc/refman/OCCT.tag:../../refman/html/" href="../../refman/html/class_a_i_s.html">AIS</a>) for working with interactive objects.</li>
<li><em>TKService</em> toolkit defines a low-level API for managing and creating presentations from primitive arrays. This toolkit defines an abstraction layer for defining an arbitrary graphic driver responsible for actual rendering.</li>
<li><em>TKOpenGl</em> toolkit implements the graphic driver using OpenGL and OpenGL ES libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>While low-level API operates with primitive arrays (triangles, lines, points), the higher level includes services for building presentations for B-Rep shapes (shaded and wireframe). A comprehensive list of standard interactive objects includes topological shape, mesh presentation, various dimensions, manipulators and others. It provides a solid basis for rapid application development, while flexible and extensible API allows development of highly customized application-specific presentations.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of OCCT Visualization features:</p><ul>
<li>Camera-driven view projection and orientation. Perspective, orthographic and stereographic projections are supported.</li>
<li>Support of Common (diffuse/ambient/specular) and PBR metallic-roughness material models.</li>
<li>Possibility to flexibly adjust appearance of dimensions in a 3D view. The 3D text object represents a given text string as a true 3D object in the model space.</li>
<li>Definition of clipping planes through the plane equation coefficients. Ability to define visual attributes for cross-section at the level or individual clipping planes. In the image below different parts of the rocket are clipped with different planes and hatched. <div class="image">

</li>
<li>Optimization of rendering performance through the algorithms of:<ul>
<li>View frustum culling, which skips the presentation outside camera at the rendering stage;</li>
<li>Back face culling, which reduces the rendered number of triangles and eliminates artifacts at shape boundaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_overview_de"></a>
Data Exchange</h2>
<p><b>Data Exchange</b> allows developing OCCT-based applications that can interact with other CAD systems by writing and reading CAD models to and from external data.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="0014.png" alt="0014.png"/>
<div class="caption">
Shape imported from STEP</div></div>
<p> <b>Data Exchange</b> is organized in a modular way as a set of interfaces that comply with various CAD formats: IGES, STEP, STL, VRML, etc. The interfaces allow software based on OCCT to exchange data with various CAD/PDM software packages, maintaining a good level of interoperability. This module handles various problems of interoperability between CAD systems, caused by differences in model validity criteria and requirements to internal representation.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Standardized Data Exchange</b> interfaces allow querying and examining the input file, converting its contents to a CAD model and running validity checks on a fully translated shape. The following formats are currently supported:<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__step.html">STEP</a> (AP203: Mechanical Design, this covers General 3D CAD; AP214: Automotive Design; AP242).</li>
<li><a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__iges.html#occt_iges_1">IGES</a> (up to 5.3).</li>
<li><b>glTF</b> 2.0 reader and writer.</li>
<li><b>OBJ</b> mesh file reader.</li>
<li><b>VRML</b> converter translates Open CASCADE shapes to VRML 1.0 files (Virtual Reality Modeling Language).</li>
<li><b>STL</b> converter translates Open CASCADE shapes to STL files. STL (STtereoLithography) format is widely used for rapid prototyping (3D printing).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__xde.html">Extended data exchange</a> (XDE) allows translating additional attributes attached to geometric data (colors, layers, names, materials etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.opencascade.com/content/advanced-data-exchange-components">Advanced Data Exchange Components</a> are available in addition to standard Data Exchange interfaces to support interoperability and data adaptation (also using <a class="el" href="index.html#intro_overview_heal">Shape Healing</a>) with CAD software using the following proprietary formats:<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These components are based on the same architecture as interfaces with STEP and IGES.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_overview_heal"></a>
Shape Healing</h2>
<p><b>Shape Healing</b> library provides algorithms to correct and adapt the geometry and topology of shapes imported to OCCT from other CAD systems.</p>
<p>Shape Healing algorithms include, but are not limited to, the following operations:</p><ul>
<li>Analyze shape characteristics and, in particular, identify the shapes that do not comply with OCCT geometry and topology validity rules by analyzing geometrical objects and topology:<ul>
<li>check edge and wire consistency;</li>
<li>check edge order in a wire;</li>
<li>check the orientation of face boundaries;</li>
<li>analyze shape tolerances;</li>
<li>identify closed and open wires in a boundary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix incorrect or incomplete shapes:<ul>
<li>provide consistency between a 3D curve and its corresponding parametric curve;</li>
<li>repair defective wires;</li>
<li>fit the shapes to a user-defined tolerance value;</li>
<li>fill gaps between patches and edges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upgrade and change shape characteristics:<ul>
<li>reduce curve and surface degree;</li>
<li>split shapes to obtain C1 continuity;</li>
<li>convert any types of curves or surfaces to Bezier or B-Spline curves or surfaces and back;</li>
<li>split closed surfaces and revolution surfaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_overview_ocaf"></a>
Application Framework</h2>
<p><b>Open CASCADE Application Framework</b> (OCAF) handles Application Data basing on the Application/Document paradigm. It uses an associativity engine to simplify the development of a CAD application thanks to the following ready-to-use features and services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data attributes managing the application data, which can be organized according to the development needs;</li>
<li>Data storage and persistence (open/save);</li>
<li>Possibility to modify and recompute attributes in documents. With OCAF it is easy to represent the history of modification and parametric dependencies within your model;</li>
<li>Possibility to manage multiple documents;</li>
<li>Predefined attributes common to CAD/CAM/CAE applications (e.g. to store dimensions);</li>
<li>Undo-Redo and Copy-Paste functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since OCAF handles the application structure, the only development task is the creation of application-specific data and GUIs.</p>
<p>OCAF differs from any other CAD framework in the organization of application data, as there the data structures are based on reference keys rather than on shapes. In a model, such attributes as shape data, color and material are attached to an invariant structure, which is deeper than the shapes. A shape object becomes the value of <em>Shape</em> attribute, in the same way as an integer number is the value of <em>Integer</em> attribute and a string is the value of <em>Name</em> attribute.</p>
<p>OCAF organizes and embeds these attributes in a document. OCAF documents, in their turn, are managed by an OCAF application.</p>

It can be used to test and prototype various algorithms before building an entire application. It includes:</p><ul>

<p>On desktop, 3D viewer for optimal performance requires graphics processing unit (GPU) supporting OpenGL 3.3 or above. Ray tracing requires OpenGL 4.0+ or OpenGL 3.3+ with <em>GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object_rgb32</em> extension. Textures within ray tracing will be available only when <em>GL_ARB_bindless_texture extension</em> is provided by driver.</p>
<p>On mobile platforms, OpenGL ES 2.0+ is required for 3D viewer (OpenGL ES 3.1+ is recommended). The ray tracing is not yet available on mobile platforms. Some old hardware might be unable to execute complex GLSL programs (e.g. with high number of light sources, clipping planes).</p>
<p>OCCT 3D Viewer, in general, supports wide range of graphics hardware - from very old to new. Therefore, if you observe some unexpected visual issues - first check for OpenGL driver update (or firmware update in case of mobile platforms); but beware that driver update might also come with new bugs. Don't forget to report these bugs to vendors.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="intro_install"></a>
Download and Installation</h1>
<p>OCCT can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.opencascade.com/content/latest-release">https://www.opencascade.com/content/latest-release</a></p>
<p>In most cases you would want to rebuild OCCT from sources on your platform (OS, compiler) before using it in your project, to ensure binary compatibility and appropriate configuration of the library. See <a class="el" href="build_upgrade.html">Build, Debug and Upgrade</a> for instructions on building OCCT from sources on supported platforms.</p>
<p>The following subsections describe how OCCT can be installed from ready-to-use packages on different platforms.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_install_windows"></a>
Windows</h2>
<p>On Windows Open CASCADE Technology with binaries precompiled by Visual C++ 2017 can be installed using installation procedure available on official download page.</p>
<p><b>Recommendation:</b></p>
<p>If you have a previous version of OCCT installed on your station, and you do not plan to use it along with the new version, you might want to uninstall the previous version (using Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs) before the installation of this new version, to avoid possible problems (conflict of system variables, paths, etc).</p>
<p>Full OCCT installation with reference documentation requires 1.8 Gb on disk.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you will find the directories for 3rd party products (some might be absent in case of custom installation) and the main <b>OCCT</b> directory:</p>
<div class="image">

<h1><a class="anchor" id="intro_env"></a>
Environment Variables</h1>
<p>To run any Open CASCADE Technology application you need to set the environment variables.</p>
<h3>On Windows</h3>
<p>You can define the environment variables with env.bat script located in the $CASROOT folder. This script accepts two arguments to be used: the version of Visual Studio (vc10 &ndash; vc142) and the architecture (win32 or win64).</p>
<p>The additional environment settings necessary for compiling OCCT libraries and samples by Microsoft Visual Studio can be set using script custom.bat located in the same folder. You might need to edit this script to correct the paths to third-party libraries if they are installed on your system in a non-default location.</p>
<p>Script msvc.bat can be used with the same arguments for immediate launch of Visual Studio for (re)compiling OCCT.</p>
<h3>On Unix</h3>
<p>If OCCT was built by Code::Blocks, you can define the environment variables with env_cbp.sh or custom_cbp.sh script.</p>
<p>If OCCT was built by Automake, you can define the environment variables with env_amk.sh or custom_amk.sh script.</p>
<p>The scripts are located in the OCCT root folder.</p>
