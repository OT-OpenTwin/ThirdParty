\title Duplicate enum entries
\brief [duplicate-enum-entries] Enum key X has already been declared.

\qmllintwarningcategory duplicate-enum-entries

\section1 Enum key X has already been declared

\section2 What happened?
An enum contains two identical entries.

\section2 Why is that bad?
The same key is associated with multiple values. It isn't clear which one will
be used.

\section2 Example
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    enum E { A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, A = 3 }
}
\endqml
To fix this warning, remove or rename duplicate enum entries:
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    enum E { A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, D = 3 }
}
\endqml
