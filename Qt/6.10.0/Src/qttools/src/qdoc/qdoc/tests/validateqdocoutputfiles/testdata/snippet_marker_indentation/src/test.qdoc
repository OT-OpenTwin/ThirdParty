    \title Snippet marker indentation test

    This page tests snippet marker indentation handling. QDoc automatically
    adjusts indentation to preserve the natural code structure regardless of
    marker placement.

    \section1 Over-indented marker example

    This snippet has markers that are more indented than the code.
    QDoc automatically uses the minimum content indentation:

    \snippet test.cpp overindented

    \section1 Correctly indented marker example

    This snippet has properly aligned markers:

    \snippet test.cpp correct

    \section1 Under-indented marker example

    This snippet has markers less indented than the code.
    QDoc preserves the marker indentation level:

    \snippet test.cpp underindented

    \section1 Mixed indentation example

    This snippet has mixed indentation levels.
    QDoc uses the minimum content indentation:

    \snippet test.cpp mixed
