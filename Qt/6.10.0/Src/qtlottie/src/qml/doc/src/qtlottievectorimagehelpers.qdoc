    \title Qt Lottie Vector Image Helpers QML Types
    \ingroup qmlmodules
    \brief Provides QML types used by VectorImage and related tools.
    \since 6.10

    This module contains types used in scenes generated by
    \l{VectorImage}, \l{lottietoqml} and related tools. The types are
    made to replicate specialized behavior defined by the vector
    graphics file formats it loads and are not intended to be
    generally useful.

    To use the types in this module, import the module with the
    following line:

    \qml
    import Qt.labs.lottieqt.VectorImageHelpers
    \endqml
