    \title lottietoqml Example

    \brief An example demonstrating the use of lottietoqml in an application.
    \ingroup qtlottieexamples
    \examplecategory {Graphics}

    This example demonstrates how the \l{lottietoqml} tool can be used to convert Lottie files
    into QML and then use these in an application.

    \note lottietoqml is currently in tech preview.

    \section1 Overview

    The example consists of nine vector animations that have been converted using \l{lottietoqml}.
    They are displayed in a grid in a full screen application window.

    If the user clicks on one of the animated images, it will zoom to fill the screen. Since the
    image is vector-based, it will remain crisp without any scaling artifacts.

    The \l{lottietoqml} does the equivalent to what \l{svgtoqml} does for .SVG files. It converts
    as much as possible of the original vector image and animation to \l{Qt Quick Shapes} and other
    \l{Qt Quick} components. The result is a fully scalable and hardware-accelerated rendering of
    the animation.

    For convenience, Lottie files can also be loaded at run-time through the \l{VectorImage}
    component. However, pregenerating the QML file is usually preferable, since this allows
    preprocessing the QML scene for faster loading.

    \section1 Assets
