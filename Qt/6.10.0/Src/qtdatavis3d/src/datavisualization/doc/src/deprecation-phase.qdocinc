\note The Qt Data Visualization module has been deprecated since Qt 6.10.
For new projects, use the \l{Qt Graphs} module instead.
Qt Graphs uses each platform's native rendering backend (Metal on
macOS, DirectX on Windows, OpenGL or Vulkan on Linux) to achieve
hardware-accelerated rendering for both 2D and 3D graphs.
To migrate from Qt Data Visualization to Qt Graphs module, refer to
\l{Qt Graphs Migration from Qt DataVisualization} or the Qt Academy
course \e {Migrating to Qt Graphs}.
