    \note Users are responsible for managing the unique RPC handlers returned
    by the \c Client interface, ensuring their existence at least until the
    \l{QGrpcOperation::} {finished} signal is emitted. After receiving this
    signal, the handler can be safely reassigned or destroyed.

    \note QGrpcHttp2Channel transports metadata as HTTP/2 headers. \b{Keys} are
    case-insensitive ASCII strings. You must avoid using the internal prefixes:
    \c{:} (pseudo-header), \c{grpc-}, or \c{qtgrpc-}. \b{Values} may be either
    ASCII strings or binary data. For more information, see
