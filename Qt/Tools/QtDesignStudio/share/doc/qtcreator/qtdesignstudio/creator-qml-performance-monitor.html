<!-- $$$creator-qml-performance-monitor.html-description -->
<div class="descr" id="details">
<p>You can use the QML Profiler to find causes for typical performance problems in your applications, such as slowness and unresponsive, stuttering user interfaces. Typical causes include executing too much JavaScript in too few frames. All JavaScript must return before the GUI thread can proceed, and frames are delayed or dropped if the GUI thread is not ready.</p>
<p>Another typical cause for similar performance problems is creating, painting, or updating invisible items, which takes time in the GUI thread.</p>
<p>To find excessive use of JavaScript, check the frame rate in animations and Scene Graph events, look for gaps, and check whether the application behaves as expected. The JavaScript category displays the run time of functions, which you should try to keep below 16 ms per frame.</p>
<p>To find problems caused by handling invisible items, look for dropped frames and check that you are not using too many short bindings or signal handlers that are updated per frame. You can also <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#visualizing-overdraw" translate="no">visualize Scene Graph overdraw</a> to check scene layout and find items that are never visible to the users because they are located outside the screen or hidden beneath other, visible elements.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><b>Note: </b>In this section, you are using advanced menu items. These are not visible by default. To toggle the visibility of advanced menu items, see <a href="creator-quick-tour.html#customizing-the-menu" translate="no">Customizing the Menu</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="using-qml-profiler">Using QML Profiler</h2>
<p>To monitor the performance of an application in the QML Profiler:</p>
<ol class="1" type="1"><li>To be able to profile an application, you must set up QML debugging for the project. For more information, see <a href="creator-debugging-qml.html#setting-up-qml-debugging" translate="no">Setting Up QML Debugging</a>.<div class="admonition note">
<p><b>Note: </b>To profile applications on <a href="studio-terms.html#glossary-device" translate="no">devices</a>, you must install Qt libraries on them.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Select <b translate="no">Analyze</b> &gt; <b translate="no">QML Profiler</b> to profile the current application.</li>
<li>Select the <img src="images/qtcreator-analyze-start-button.png" alt="" /> (<b translate="no">Start</b>) button to start the application from the QML Profiler.<div class="admonition note">
<p><b>Note: </b>If data collection does not start automatically, select the <img src="images/recordfill.png" alt="" /> (<b translate="no">Enable Profiling</b>) button.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When you start analyzing an application, the application is launched, and the QML Profiler immediately begins to collect data. This is indicated by the time running in the <b translate="no">Elapsed</b> field.</p>
<p>Data is collected until you select the <b translate="no">Enable Profiling</b> button. Data collection takes time, and therefore, there might be a delay before the data is displayed.</p>
<p>Do not use application commands to exit the application because data is sent to the QML Profiler when you select the <b translate="no">Enable Profiling</b> button. The application continues to run for some seconds, after which it is stopped automatically. If you exit the application, the data is not sent.</p>
<p>Select the <b translate="no">Disable Profiling</b> button to disable the automatic start of the data collection when an application is launched. Data collection starts when you select the button again.</p>
<p>To save all the collected data, select <b translate="no">Analyze</b> &gt; <b translate="no">QML Profiler Options</b> &gt; <b translate="no">Save QML Trace</b>. To view the saved data, select <b translate="no">Load QML Trace</b>. You can also deliver the saved data to others for examination or load data saved by them.</p>
<h2 id="specifying-flushing-settings">Specifying Flushing Settings</h2>
<p>You can specify flushing settings for the QML Profiler either globally for all projects or separately for each project. To specify global settings, select <a href="creator-how-to-find-preferences.html" translate="no">Preferences</a> &gt; <b translate="no">Analyzer</b>.</p>
<p>To specify custom QML Profiler settings for a particular project, select <b translate="no">Projects</b> &gt; <b translate="no">Run</b> and then select <b translate="no">Custom</b> in <b translate="no">QML Profiler Settings</b>. To restore the global settings for the project, select <b translate="no">Restore Global</b>.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qml-profiler-settings.png" alt="&quot;QML Profiler Settings&quot;" /></p><p>Select the <b translate="no">Flush data while profiling</b> check box to flush the data periodically instead of flushing all data when profiling stops. This saves memory on the target device and shortens the wait between the profiling being stopped and the data being displayed.</p>
<p>In the <b translate="no">Flush interval</b> field, set the flush interval in milliseconds. The shorter the interval, the more often the data is flushed. The longer the interval, the more data has to be buffered in the target application, potentially wasting memory. However, the flushing itself takes time, which can distort the profiling results.</p>
<p>If you have multiple QML engines and you want to aggregate the data produced by all of them into one trace, select the <b translate="no">Process data only when process ends</b> check box. Otherwise, the profiling stops when one of the engines stops.</p>
<h2 id="attaching-to-running-qt-quick-applications">Attaching to Running Qt Quick Applications</h2>
<p>You can profile Qt Quick applications that are not launched by Qt Design Studio. However, you must enable QML debugging and profiling for the application in the project build settings. For more information, see <a href="creator-debugging-qml.html#setting-up-qml-debugging" translate="no">Setting Up QML Debugging</a>.</p>
<p>To attach to waiting applications:</p>
<ol class="1" type="1"><li>Select <b translate="no">Analyze</b> &gt; <b translate="no">QML Profiler (Attach to Waiting Application)</b>.<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qml-profiler-start-dialog.png" alt="&quot;Start QML Profiler dialog&quot;" /></p></li>
<li>In <b translate="no">Kit</b>, select the kit used to build the application.</li>
<li>In <b translate="no">Port</b>, specify the port to listen to.</li>
<li>Select <b translate="no">OK</b>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="analyzing-collected-data">Analyzing Collected Data</h2>
<p>The <b translate="no">Timeline</b> view displays graphical representations of QML and JavaScript execution and a condensed view of all recorded events.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qtcreator-qml-performance-monitor.png" alt="&quot;QML Profiler&quot;" /></p><p>Each row in the timeline (6) describes a type of QML events that were recorded. Move the cursor on an event on a row to see how long it takes and where in the source it is being called. To display the information only when an event is selected, disable the <b translate="no">View Event Information on Mouseover</b> button (4).</p>
<p>The outline (10) summarizes the period for which data was collected. Drag the zoom range (8) or click the outline to move on the outline. You can also move between events by selecting the <b translate="no">Jump to Previous Event</b> and <b translate="no">Jump to Next Event</b> buttons (1).</p>
<p>Select the <b translate="no">Show Zoom Slider</b> button (2) to open a slider that you can use to set the zoom level. You can also drag the zoom handles (9). To reset the default zoom level, right-click the timeline to open the context menu, and select <b translate="no">Reset Zoom</b>.</p>
<p>Click the time ruler to add vertical orientation lines (5) to the timeline.</p>
<h3 id="selecting-event-ranges">Selecting Event Ranges</h3>
<p>You can select an event range (7) to view the frame rate of events and to compare it with the frame rate of similar events. Select the <b translate="no">Select Range</b> button (3) to activate the selection tool. Then click in the timeline to specify the beginning of the event range. Drag the selection handle to define the end of the range. The length of the range indicates the frame rate of the event.</p>
<p>You can use event ranges also to measure delays between two subsequent events. Place a range between the end of the first event and the beginning of the second event. The <b translate="no">Duration</b> field displays the delay between the events in milliseconds.</p>
<p>To zoom into an event range, double-click it.</p>
<p>To narrow down the current range in the <b translate="no">Timeline</b>, <b translate="no">Statistics</b>, and <b translate="no">Flame Graph</b> views, right-click the range and select <b translate="no">Analyze Current Range</b>. To return to the full range, select <b translate="no">Analyze Full Range</b> in the context menu.</p>
<p>To remove an event range, close the <b translate="no">Selection</b> dialog.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-data">Understanding the Data</h3>
<p>Generally, events in the timeline view indicate how long QML or JavaScript execution took. Move the mouse over them to see details. For most events, they include location in source code, duration and some relevant parts of the source code itself.</p>
<p>You can click on an event to move the cursor in the code editor to the part of the code the event is associated with.</p>
<p>The following types of events are displayed in the timeline view on one or several rows. The availability of event types depends on the version of Qt the application was compiled with and the version of Qt Quick it is using.</p>

<h3 id="analyzing-scene-graph-events">Analyzing Scene Graph Events</h3>
<p>In order to understand the scene graph category, it's important to understand how the Qt Quick scene graph works. See <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html" translate="no">Qt Quick Scene Graph</a> and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html" translate="no">Qt Quick Scene Graph Default Renderer</a> for a detailed description. The following events are reported in the <b translate="no">Scene Graph</b> category. Not all events are generated by all render loops. In the Windows and Basic render loops everything runs in the same thread and the distinction between GUI thread and render thread is meaningless.</p>
<p>If you set the environment variable QSG_RENDER_TIMING, you get a textual output of similar, but slightly different timings from the application being profiled. For easier orientation, the differences are listed below.</p>
<div class="table"><table class="generic">

<p>JavaScript events are shown in the <b translate="no">Statistics</b> view only for applications that use Qt Quick 2 and are compiled with Qt 5.3 or later.</p>
<h3 id="visualizing-statistics-as-flame-graphs">Visualizing Statistics as Flame Graphs</h3>
<p>The <b translate="no">Flame Graph</b> view shows a more concise statistical overview of QML and JavaScript execution. In the <b translate="no">Total Time</b> view, the horizontal bars show the amount of time all invocations of a certain function took together, relative to the total runtime of all JavaScript and QML events. The nesting shows which functions were called by which other ones.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qml-profiler-flamegraph.png" alt="&quot;Flame Graph View&quot;" /></p><p>To view the total amount of memory allocated by the functions, select <b translate="no">Memory</b> in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>To view the number of memory allocations performed by the functions, select <b translate="no">Allocations</b>.</p>
<p>Double-click an item in a view to zoom into it. Double-click an empty area in the view to zoom out again.</p>
<p>Unlike the <b translate="no">Timeline</b> view, the <b translate="no">Flame Graph</b> view does not show the time spans when no QML or JavaScript is running at all. Thus, it is not suitable for analyzing per frame execution times. However, it is very easy to see the total impact of the various QML and JavaScript events there.</p>
