<!-- $$$qtbridge-ai.html-description -->
<div class="descr" id="details">
<p>Even though Qt Design Studio does not provide a specific export bridge for Adobe Illustrator, you can design UIs in it and export your designs to Qt Design Studio in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place your Illustrator content into Adobe Photoshop and use Qt Bridge for Adobe Photoshop to export the assets to <i>.metadata</i> format that you can import to Qt Design Studio.</li>
<li>Use the Illustrator <i>export for screens workflow</i> to export your assets into formats supported by Qt Design Studio, such as PNG and JPEG.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="placing-illustrator-content-into-photoshop">Placing Illustrator Content into Photoshop</h2>
<p>You can place Illustrator content into Photoshop in several ways. If you select <b translate="no">File</b> &gt; <b translate="no">Place linked</b> in Illustrator, the content updates automatically. However, the whole file content is placed on a single Photoshop layer, which means that you cannot use Qt Bridge for Adobe Photoshop to export the individual parts of the Illustrator design.</p>
<p>Therefore, you have to copy-paste your assets to Photoshop as <i>smart objects</i>, one by one, at the layer level. You can then specify export settings for Qt Bridge for Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>If you need to edit smart objects after copying them to Photoshop, you can double-click them in Photoshop to open them in Illustrator. Because you use smart objects, all your changes are propagated to all instances of the objects used in your designs in Photoshop. For more information about using smart objects, see the Illustrator and Photoshop documentation.</p>
<p>For more information about exporting designs from Photoshop, see <a href="psqtbridge.html" translate="no">Exporting Designs from Adobe Photoshop</a>.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-assets-for-screens">Exporting Assets for Screens</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is easier to just export layers and artboards from Illustrator and to create scalable layouts and UI flows in Qt Design Studio. You can export assets to multiple formats and sizes, such as PNG, JPEG, and SVG.</p>
