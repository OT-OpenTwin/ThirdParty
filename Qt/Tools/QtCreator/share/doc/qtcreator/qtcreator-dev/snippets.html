<!-- $$$Snippets-description -->
<div class="descr"> <a name="details"></a>
<p>Snippets typically consist of chunks of code in a programming language (although they can also be plain text) which you would like to avoid re-typing every time. They are triggered in the same way as the completions (see <a href="codeassist.html">Providing Code Assist</a>).</p>
<p>In order to create a new group of snippets two steps are necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register the group with TextEditor::SnippetProvider::registerGroup</li>
<li>Create an XML configuration file and place it in the /share/qtcreator/snippets directory. As an example of the file format please take a look at the already available ones. The meaning and consistency rules of the fields are described below:<ul>
<li>group - This is the group in which the snippet belongs in the user interface. It must match TextEditor::SnippetProvider::groupId().</li>
<li>id - A unique string that identifies this snippet among all others available. The recommended practice is to prefix it with the group so it is easier to have such control on a file level.</li>
<li>trigger - The sequence of characters to be compared by the completion engine in order to display this snippet as a code assist proposal.</li>
<li>complement - Additional information that is displayed in the code assist proposal so it is possible to disambiguate similar snippets that have the same trigger.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All XML configuration files found in the directory mentioned above are parsed by Qt Creator. However, only the ones which are associated with known groups (specified by a provider) are taken into consideration.</p>
