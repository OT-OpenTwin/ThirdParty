<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/creator_buildingrunning.png" alt="" /></p><p>Qt Creator provides support for running and deploying Qt applications built for different target platforms, or using different compilers, debuggers, or Qt versions. <a href="creator-glossary.html#glossary-buildandrun-kit">Kits</a> define the tools, <a href="creator-glossary.html#glossary-device">device</a> type and other settings to use when building and running your project.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="creator-building-targets.html">Building for Multiple Platforms</a><p><i>Build configurations</i> contain everything you need to compile the sources into binaries. Build configurations use the tools and settings defined in their corresponding kit.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="creator-running-targets.html">Running on Multiple Platforms</a><p><i>Run configurations</i> start the application in the location where it was copied by the <i>deploy configuration</i>. By default, when you select the <b>Run</b> function, Qt Creator builds the project, deploys it to the device defined in the kit, and runs it there. However, if you have not made any changes to the project since you last built and deployed it, Qt Creator simply runs it again.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="creator-deployment.html">Deploying to Devices</a><p><i>Deploy configurations</i> handle the packaging and copying of the necessary files to a location you want to run the executable at. The files can be copied to a location in the file system of the development PC or a device.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="creator-connecting-mobile.html">Connecting Devices</a><p>When you install tool chains for device types as part of a Qt distribution, the build and run settings for the devices might be set up automatically. However, you might need to install and configure some additional software on the devices to be able to connect to them from the development PC.</p>
