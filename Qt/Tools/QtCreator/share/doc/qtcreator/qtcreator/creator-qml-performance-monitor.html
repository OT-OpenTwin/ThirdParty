<span class="subtitle"></span>
<!-- $$$creator-qml-performance-monitor.html-description -->
<div class="descr"> <a name="details"></a>
<p>You can use the QML Profiler to find causes for typical performance problems in your applications, such as slowness and unresponsive, stuttering user interfaces. Typical causes include executing too much JavaScript in too few frames. All JavaScript must return before the GUI thread can proceed, and frames are delayed or dropped if the GUI thread is not ready.</p>
<p>Another typical cause for similar performance problems is creating, painting, or updating invisible items, which takes time in the GUI thread.</p>
<p>Triggering long-running C++ functions, such as paint methods and signal handlers, also takes time in the GUI thread, but is more difficult to see in the QML Profiler, because it does not profile C++ code. To find excessive use of JavaScript, check the frame rate in animations and Scene Graph events, look for gaps, and check whether the application behaves as expected. The JavaScript category displays the run time of functions, which you should try to keep below 16 ms per frame.</p>
<p>To find problems caused by handling invisible items, look for dropped frames and check that you are not using too many short bindings or signal handlers that are updated per frame. You can also <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#visualizing-overdraw">visualize Scene Graph overdraw</a> to check scene layout and find items that are never visible to the users, because they are located outside the screen or hidden beneath other, visible elements.</p>
<p>If frames get dropped even though JavaScript is not being run, and there are large, unexplained gaps in the timeline, check your custom <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickitem.html">QQuickItem</a> implementations. You can use <a href="creator-valgrind-overview.html">Valgrind</a> or other general purpose profilers to analyze C++ code.</p>
<a name="using-qml-profiler"></a>
<h2 id="using-qml-profiler">Using QML Profiler</h2>
<p>To monitor the performance of an application in the QML Profiler:</p>
<ol class="1" type="1"><li>To be able to profile an application, you must set up QML debugging for the project. For more information, see <a href="creator-debugging-qml.html#setting-up-qml-debugging">Setting Up QML Debugging</a>.</li>
<li>In the <b>Projects</b> mode, select a <a href="creator-glossary.html#glossary-buildandrun-kit">kit</a> with Qt version 4.7&#x2e;4 or later.<p><b>Note: </b>To profile applications on <a href="creator-glossary.html#glossary-device">devices</a>, you must install Qt 4.7&#x2e;4 or later libraries on them.</p></li>
<li>Select <b>Analyze &gt; QML Profiler</b> to profile the current application.</li>
<li>Select the <img src="images/qtcreator-analyze-start-button.png" alt="" /> (<b>Start</b>) button to start the application from the QML Profiler.<p><b>Note: </b>If data collection does not start automatically, select the <img src="images/recordfill.png" alt="" /> (<b>Enable Profiling</b>) button.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When you start analyzing an application, the application is launched, and the QML Profiler immediately begins to collect data. This is indicated by the time running in the <b>Elapsed</b> field.</p>
<p>Data is collected until you select the <b>Enable Profiling</b> button. Data collection takes time, and therefore, there might be a delay before the data is displayed.</p>
<p>Do not use application commands to exit the application, because data is sent to the QML Profiler when you select the <b>Enable Profiling</b> button. The application continues to run for some seconds, after which it is stopped automatically. If you exit the application, the data is not sent.</p>
<p>Select the <b>Disable Profiling</b> button to disable the automatic start of the data collection when an application is launched. Data collection starts when you select the button again.</p>
<p>To save all the collected data, right-click any QML Profiler view to open the context menu, and then select <b>Save QML Trace</b>. To view the saved data, select <b>Load QML Trace</b>. You can also deliver the saved data to other developers for examination or load data saved by them.</p>
<a name="specifying-flushing-settings"></a>
<h2 id="specifying-flushing-settings">Specifying Flushing Settings</h2>
<p>You can specify flushing settings for the QML Profiler either globally for all projects or separately for each project. To specify global settings, select <b>Tools</b> &gt; <b>Options</b> &gt; <b>Analyzer</b>.</p>
<p>To specify custom QML Profiler settings for a particular project, select <b>Projects</b> &gt; <b>Run</b> and then select <b>Custom</b> in <b>QML Profiler Settings</b>. To restore the global settings for the project, select <b>Restore Global</b>.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qml-profiler-settings.png" alt="&quot;QML Profiler Settings&quot;" /></p><p>Select the <b>Flush data while profiling</b> check box to flush the data periodically instead of flushing all data when profiling stops. This saves memory on the target device and shortens the wait between the profiling being stopped and the data being displayed.</p>
<p>In the <b>Flush interval</b> field, set the flush interval in milliseconds. The shorter the interval, the more often the data is flushed. The longer the interval, the more data has to be buffered in the target application, potentially wasting memory. However, the flushing itself takes time, which can distort the profiling results.</p>
<p>If you have multiple QML engines and you want to aggregate the data produced by all of them into one trace, select the <b>Process data only when process ends</b> check box. Otherwise, the profiling stops when one of the engines stops.</p>
<a name="attaching-to-running-qt-quick-applications"></a>
<h2 id="attaching-to-running-qt-quick-applications">Attaching to Running Qt Quick Applications</h2>
<p>To profile Qt Quick applications that are not launched by Qt Creator, select <b>Analyze &gt; QML Profiler (External)</b>. You must enable QML debugging and profiling for the application in the project build settings. For more information, see <a href="creator-debugging-qml.html#setting-up-qml-debugging">Setting Up QML Debugging</a>.</p>
<p>In the <b>QML Profiler</b> dialog, <b>Port</b> field, specify the port to listen to.</p>
<a name="analyzing-collected-data"></a>
<h2 id="analyzing-collected-data">Analyzing Collected Data</h2>
<p>The <b>Timeline</b> view displays graphical representations of QML and JavaScript execution and a condensed view of all recorded events.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qtcreator-qml-performance-monitor.png" alt="&quot;QML Profiler&quot;" /></p><p>Each row in the timeline (6) describes a type of QML events that were recorded. Move the cursor on an event on a row to see how long it takes and where in the source it is being called. To display the information only when an event is selected, disable the <b>View Event Information on Mouseover</b> button (4).</p>
<p>The outline (10) summarizes the period for which data was collected. Drag the zoom range (8) or click the outline to move on the outline. You can also move between events by selecting the <b>Jump to Previous Event</b> and <b>Jump to Next Event</b> buttons (1).</p>
<p>Select the <b>Show Zoom Slider</b> button (2) to open a slider that you can use to set the zoom level. You can also drag the zoom handles (9). To reset the default zoom level, right-click the timeline to open the context menu, and select <b>Reset Zoom</b>.</p>
<p>Click the time ruler to add vertical orientation lines (5) to the timeline.</p>
<a name="selecting-event-ranges"></a>
<h3 >Selecting Event Ranges</h3>
<p>You can select an event range (7) to view the frame rate of events and to compare it with the frame rate of similar events. Select the <b>Select Range</b> button (3) to activate the selection tool. Then click in the timeline to specify the beginning of the event range. Drag the selection handle to define the end of the range. The length of the range indicates the frame rate of the event.</p>
<p>You can use event ranges also to measure delays between two subsequent events. Place a range between the end of the first event and the beginning of the second event. The <b>Duration</b> field displays the delay between the events in milliseconds.</p>
<p>To zoom into an event range, double-click it.</p>
<p>To narrow down the current range in the <b>Timeline</b>, <b>Statistics</b>, and <b>Flame Graph</b> views, right-click the range and select <b>Analyze Current Range</b>. To return to the full range, select <b>Analyze Full Range</b> in the context menu.</p>
<p>To remove an event range, close the <b>Selection</b> dialog.</p>
<a name="understanding-the-data"></a>
<h3 >Understanding the Data</h3>
<p>Generally, events in the timeline view indicate how long QML or JavaScript execution took. Move the mouse over them to see details. For most events, they include location in source code, duration and some relevant parts of the source code itself.</p>
<p>You can click on an event to move the cursor in the code editor to the part of the code the event is associated with.</p>
<p>The following types of events are displayed in the timeline view on one or several rows. The availability of event types depends on the version of Qt the application was compiled with and the version of Qt Quick it is using.</p>
<div class="table"><table class="generic">
 <thead><tr class="qt-style"><th >Event Category</th><th >Description</th><th >Minimum Qt Version</th><th >Qt Quick Version</th></tr></thead>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td ><b>Pixmap Cache</b></td><td >Displays the general amount of pixmap data cached, in pixels. In addition, displays a separate event for each picture being loaded, with specifics about its file name and size.</td><td >Qt 5.1</td><td >Qt Quick 2</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td ><b>Scene Graph</b></td><td >Displays the time when scene graph frames are rendered and some additional timing information for the various stages executed to do so.</td><td >Qt 5.1</td><td >Qt Quick 2</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td ><b>Memory Usage</b></td><td >Displays block allocations of the JavaScript memory manager. Generally, the memory manager will reserve larger blocks of memory in one piece and later hand them out to the application in smaller bits. If the application requests single blocks of memory surpassing a certain size, the memory manager will allocate those separately. Those two modes of operation are shown as events of different colors. The second row displays the actual usage of the allocated memory. This is the amount of JavaScript heap the application has actually requested.</td><td >Qt 5.4</td><td >Qt Quick 2</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td ><b>Input Events</b></td><td >Displays mouse and keyboard events.</td><td >Qt 4.7&#x2e;4</td><td >Qt Quick 1 or Qt Quick 2</td></tr>

The first stage is for the creation of the data structures, including child elements. The second stage represents the completion callbacks. Not all elements trigger completion callbacks, though. The stages are shown as separate events in the timeline. For Qt Quick 2 applications compiled with versions of Qt before 5.2&#x2e;1 only the creation of top-level elements is shown, as single events.</td><td >Qt 4.7&#x2e;4 (Qt 5.2&#x2e;1)</td><td >Qt Quick 1 or Qt Quick 2</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td ><b>Binding</b></td><td >Displays the time when a binding is evaluated and how long the evaluation takes.</td><td >Qt 4.7&#x2e;4</td><td >Qt Quick 1 or Qt Quick 2</td></tr>

<a name="analyzing-scene-graph-events"></a>
<h3 >Analyzing Scene Graph Events</h3>
<p>In order to understand the scene graph category, it's important to understand how the Qt Quick scene graph works. See <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html">Qt Quick Scene Graph</a> and Qt Quick Scene Graph Renderer for a detailed description. The following events are reported in the <b>Scene Graph</b> category. Not all events are generated by all render loops. In the Windows and Basic render loops everything runs in the same thread and the distinction between GUI thread and render thread is meaningless.</p>
<p>If you set the environment variable QSG_RENDER_TIMING, you get a textual output of similar, but slightly different timings from the application being profiled. For easier orientation, the differences are listed below.</p>
<div class="table"><table class="generic">
 <thead><tr class="qt-style"><th >Event Type</th><th >Thread</th><th >Render Loop Types</th><th >Label in output of QSG_RENDER_TIMING</th><th >Description</th><th >Caveats</th></tr></thead>

</table></div>
<a name="viewing-statistics"></a>
<h2 id="viewing-statistics">Viewing Statistics</h2>
<p>The <b>Statistics</b> view displays the number of times each binding, create, compile, JavaScript, or signal event is triggered and the average time it takes. This allows you to examine which events you need to optimize. A high number of occurrences might indicate that an event is triggered unnecessarily. To view the median, longest, and shortest time for the occurrences, select <b>Extended Event Statistics</b> in the context menu.</p>
<p>Click on an event to move to it in the source code in the code editor.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qml-profiler-statistics.png" alt="&quot;Statistics view&quot;" /></p><p>The <b>Callers</b> and <b>Callees</b> panes show dependencies between events. They allow you to examine the internal functions of the application. The <b>Callers</b> pane summarizes the QML events that trigger a binding. This tells you what caused a change in a binding. The <b>Callees</b> pane summarizes the QML events that a binding triggers. This tells you which QML events are affected if you change a binding.</p>
<p>Click on an event to move to it in the source code in the code editor.</p>
<p>When you select an event in the <b>Timeline</b> view, information about it is displayed in the <b>Statistics</b> and <b>Flame Graph</b> views.</p>
<p>To copy the contents of one view or row to the clipboard, select <b>Copy Table</b> or <b>Copy Row</b> in the context menu.</p>
<p>JavaScript events are shown in the <b>Statistics</b> view only for applications that use Qt Quick 2 and are compiled with Qt 5.3 or later.</p>
<a name="visualizing-statistics-as-flame-graphs"></a>
<h3 >Visualizing Statistics as Flame Graphs</h3>
<p>The <b>Flame Graph</b> view shows a more concise statistical overview of QML and JavaScript execution. In the <b>Visualize Total Time</b> view, the horizontal bars show the amount of time all invocations of a certain function took together, relative to the total runtime of all JavaScript and QML events. The nesting shows which functions were called by which other ones.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qml-profiler-flamegraph.png" alt="&quot;Flame Graph View&quot;" /></p><p>To view the total amount of memory allocated by the functions in the <b>Visualize Memory</b> view, select <b>Memory</b> in the drop-down menu (1).</p>
<p>To view the the number of memory allocations performed by the functions in the <b>Visualize Allocations</b> view, select <b>Allocations</b> in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Double-click an item in a view to zoom into it. Double-click an empty area in the view to zoom out again.</p>
<p>Unlike the <b>Timeline</b> view, the <b>Flame Graph</b> view does not show the time spans when no QML or JavaScript is running at all. Thus, it is not suitable for analyzing per frame execution times. However, it is very easy to see the total impact of the various QML and JavaScript events there.</p>
